# gmCStrike-1.6
The rebuild of "Schwarz's CS 1.6 SWEPs" with better code and weapon behavior. Now it looks like CS 1.6 instead of piece of shit.

**CURRENTLY IS IN ALPHA DEVELOPMENT STATE**

## Features
- Based on CS 1.6 source code.
- Weapon behavior is same like in CS 1.6
- Old-school camera movement
- CS 1.6 ammo types

## Completed weapons
- Knife
- USP, Glock-18, P228, Deagle, Five-Seven, Dual Elites
- M3, XM1014
- MP5N, TMP, UMP-45, MAC-10, P90
- M4A1, AK-47, Galil

## Known bugs
- Sometimes fast-switching weapon, you can hear again the sound of draw animation. I don't care why this happens, why EmitSound do not blocking the same sound. This is not prediction bug.

## Workshop
I will upload this on Steam Workshop when it'll be ready.
